***Terms of Use for Workout Waves***


**Introduction**

Welcome to Workout Waves! Please read through these Terms of Service.

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Workout Waves mobile application, created and operated by Victor Fredriksson ("Developer", "I", "me", "my").

Our Privacy Policy is also integral to these Terms, detailing how your data is collected, protected, and utilized through your use of Workout Waves. You can read it here: https://github.com/DueCue/Workout-Waves-Aggrements/blob/main/Workout%20Waves%20Privacy%20Policy.md.

By engaging with Workout Waves, you acknowledge and consent to these Terms and our Privacy Policy ("Agreements"). If for any reason you disagree with these Agreements or cannot abide by them, unfortunately, you will not be able to use the Workout Waves service. However, we encourage you to contact us at duecuesupp@outlook.com so we can try to find a solution together.

Thank you for your understanding and responsibility.


**Content and Use**

Currently, Workout Waves does not support content sharing among users, but it may be a feature introduced in the future. Until then, and as the service evolves, you are responsible for any content you may eventually be able to post, ensuring its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By engaging with any future content-sharing functionalities, you affirm that you own or have the necessary rights to any content you share, and that sharing this content does not infringe on any rights of third parties.


**Account Management**

When creating an account with Workout Waves, the information you provide must be accurate, complete, and updated regularly. Failure to do so might result in the termination of your account.

Your account and password confidentiality is your responsibility. We cannot be held responsible for any unauthorized use of your account that stems from your failure to secure your account credentials.

You agree to notify us promptly at duecuesupp@outlook.com if you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of your account.


**Intellectual Property**

Workout Waves and its original content (excluding any user-provided content), features, and functionality are the sole property of Victor Fredriksson and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other applicable laws.


**External Links**

Workout Waves may contain links to third-party websites or services that we do not own or control. We assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. We advise you to review the terms and privacy policies of any third-party sites or services you visit.


**Limitation of Liability**

Your use of Workout Waves is at your own risk. Except where prohibited, neither we nor Workout Waves will be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of or inability to use the service.


**Termination**

We reserve the right to immediately terminate or suspend your account and restrict access to the Service without any prior notice or liability, at our sole discretion, for any reason at all, especially if there's a breach of these Terms.

If you wish to terminate your account, please contact us at duecuesupp@outlook.com, and we will assist you with the process.

Certain provisions of these Terms are intended to remain in effect even after termination, including but not limited to ownership rights, disclaimers of warranty, indemnity clauses, and limitations of liability.


**Amendments and Changes**

Workout Waves is a dynamic platform, and as such, we reserve the right to modify or discontinue the service without notice. We also reserve the right to amend these Terms at any time. It's your duty to periodically check these Terms for changes.

If you continue to use our Service after revisions take effect, you accept and agree to be bound by the updated Terms. Should you disagree with the revised terms, you must cease using our Service immediately.


**Subscriptions and Payments**

Certain features of the Service are available through paid subscriptions. Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis, known as the "Billing Cycle." Depending on your choice and Workout Waves capabilities at the time of purchase, Billing Cycles may be monthly or yearly.

Your subscription will automatically renew under the same terms unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current Billing Cycle. Cancellations can be managed through your iTunes/Google Play account settings. If you subscribe during a free trial period and then make a purchase, any unused portion of the free trial will be forfeited. Paid subscription fees are non-refundable, except as required by law.


**Governing Law**

These Terms are governed by the laws of Sweden, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

Not enforcing any part of these Terms doesn't mean we're giving up those rights. Should a court find any part of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, the rest will still apply. These Terms are the full agreement between us about the Service, replacing any previous understandings or agreements about it.


**Communication Preferences**

By creating an account with Workout Waves, you agree to receive newsletters, marketing, and other communications from us. You can opt out of these communications at any time.


**Acknowledgment and Contact**

By using Workout Waves, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
